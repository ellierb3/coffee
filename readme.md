For my project I created a website for a coffee shop that I have called "Nowhere-ville Coffee Co.". The 3 features that I chose to use were: flexbox, ":nth-child", and javascript function that calculates something and displays it back on the page. For my media query that targets tablets I have applied a flexbox property to display the menu div as a column that grows by one while also centering the main navigation links. For my media query that targets larger screens I have the same flexbox set to row and my main navigation links off to the right. For my ":nth-child" feature I chose to target the unordered list "#menu" and display every other list item with a different background color in my media query for screens with max-width of 500px. I chose to do a suggestion box for my javascript function that takes the user's menu suggestion and displays it back as an alert. This function is located by clicking the 'leave a suggestion' link in the main navigation bar.
